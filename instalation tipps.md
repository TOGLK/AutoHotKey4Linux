# AutoKey files are Python files (.py)

best practice:

i start them by using the AutoKey GUI
i put them into   

/home/YourName/.config/autokey/data/AutoHotKey4Linux

there you probably find other sample folder like

/home/YourName/.config/autokey/data/Sample Scripts

# AutoKey files (.ahk)

could placed everywhere.

i put them into   

/home/YourName/.config/autokey/data/AutoHotKey4Linux

to start ahk files simply click them (need installed wine before).

# github installation

i simply installed all files to
/home/YourName/.config/autokey/data/AutoHotKey4Linux
by simply checkout into that dicectory:

https://github.com/sl5net/AutoHotKey4Linux.git

# what you find here

there is am bunch of files. some are old, should may deleted.
read the filename and you should understand what they trying to do.

for test something normally you use two files. 
its all for comunication beetween these py files and the ahk files.

# recommendations

use a tools like copyQ. config it not to use  HTML (Items>HTML/RTF: off)

So your clipboard is maybe more readable. i not sure of that.
