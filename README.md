# AutoHotKey4Linux version 0.00000001 Alpha
AutoHotKey wrapper, for using AutoHotKey in Linux  

using AutoKey, AutoHotKey, wine

You need to install first:

wine for Linux  and 
AutoHotKey and  
AutoKey for Linux

# Motivation:

  - The (normal) AutoHotkey installation on Linux with Wine currently has 
  difficulty interrogating the keyboard without this tool.
  - The transfer of keystrokes to VirtualBox guests 
  without to focus the guest can thus be made possible.
